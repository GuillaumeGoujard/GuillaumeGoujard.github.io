I’m a 4th-year PhD student in UC Berkeley’s eCAL, advised by Prof. Scott Moura. My research focuses on leveraging mathematical optimization to incorporate and analyze structure in energy systems. 

I enjoy applying my research to industry problems: I’ve interned at Heila Technologoies, Tesla, and was a part time researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
